## What is Mapathon
Mapathon is map making competition for a specific problem statement. This event, organised jointly by IIT Bombay, AICTE and ISRO, will invite all Indians - to produce maps using Indian remote sensing data. The primary objective is to understand the potential of Indian remote sensing data and make maps for Indian regions using free open source mapping software (QGIS). The participants will collectively work in a crowd sourcing method for jointly producing thematic maps of India using Indian remote sensing data.

## About Mapathon
The data collected from Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) platforms have tremendous potential in mapping Indiaâ€™s resources, agriculture, climate and disaster management, rural and urban planning and in identifying pathways for future development. Such maps can be created using free open source platforms (such as QGIS). Let us join together to create such maps through the Mapathon and end to end innovative solutions through the Hackathon.

## Topic in which we have worked on

### Road Network / Drainage Maps
- We have generated a map for the drainage pipelines and Road Network using (QGIS) open source tool [link](https://github.com/qgis) of Chandigarh City
- We have generated Different kind of layers Including Base data layer, Vector data Layer, and Raster Data Layer
- We have Extracted Data From [Bhuvan-India geo-platform of ISRO](https://bhuvan.nrsc.gov.in/bhuvan_links.php)
- We have build this map for Chandigarh, India
